# LearningJax

Earlier I didn't get any chance to experiment with JAX framwork. I was just knowing that it is an amazing thing that can accelerate Deep Learning by more **efficient numpy operation execution**, **Efficient Differentiation** and **Parallel Computation**. 

I come across this post on tweeter

and it motivated me to learn it everyday and take part in #27DaysofJax challenge.

I wanted to keep track of my learning in this repository.

## Goals:
- [ ] Complete JAX-101 Course
- [ ] Collect and Go through Amazing Blogs on JAX
- [ ] Create and Collect JAX Learning Resources

## Day1:

Earlier I was considering the JAX NumPy array and normal NumPy array as almost the same but there is a difference.

To Overcome this we can create a new copy of the JAX Numpy array like this,

## Day2:

Train Simple MLP in JAX
